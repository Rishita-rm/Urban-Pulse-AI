> **UrbanPulse AI** is an intelligent geospatial decision-support system that helps users overcome **analysis paralysis** when choosing where to live in large metropolitan cities.

Unlike traditional real estate platforms that rely on static listings, UrbanPulse dynamically computes **personalized Livability Scores** using **persona-driven algorithms**, real-time geospatial analytics, and **generative AI insights**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban relocation decisions suffer from:
- Too many neighborhoods
- Conflicting metrics (price vs commute vs lifestyle)
- Lack of qualitative, human-centered insights

**UrbanPulse AI solves this by unifying quantitative geospatial data with qualitative AI reasoning into a single livability score.**

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

UrbanPulse calculates a **Livability Score** using:

```
Livability Score = Σ (Metric Score × Persona Weight)
```

Where persona weights automatically adjust for:
- Founders (commute, growth, ROI)
- Students (rent, connectivity, amenities)
- Families (safety, schools, long-term value)
